# Power-BI:  Data Visualization and Story telling

# A. COVID-19 NIGERIA: 
Due to health concerns for their staff, the top managemenet of a company which has branches spread in several states in Nigeria 
is looking for real time information on COVID 19 that will inform them on the best business strategies to consider in a bid to minimize loss.
To achieve this, real time data was obtained from http://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/ and loaded into Power BI. 
A report was created using visuals like maps, graphs, charts and sliders. Among the 37 states observed, 
a quarter million cases of COVID 19 was registered and over 3000 deaths, predominantly in Lagos, FCT and Rivers States. 
I recommended that stricter sanitary measures be observed at the branch offices in these cities.
